# Dockerfile for Web Frontend (React/TypeScript)
# Multi-stage build: Build stage + Production stage

# Stage 1: Build the React app
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY web/package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci

# Copy web source code
COPY web/ ./

# Build the application
# Don't set VITE_API_URL so it uses relative URLs (nginx proxies /api/ to backend)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production server (serve static files)
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy built files from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy nginx configuration (SPA routing + API proxy)
COPY web/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Nginx starts automatically, no CMD needed
