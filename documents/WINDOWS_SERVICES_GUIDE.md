# Windows Services Guide

## Overview

The installer creates **4 separate Windows services**, each handling a specific aspect of automated trading. This modular approach allows you to:
- Run only the services you need
- Start/stop services independently
- Monitor each component separately
- Scale resources per service

## Services Created

### 1. ModularTradeAgent_Main

## Service Control Scripts

### Start All Services
```cmd
START_ALL_SERVICES.bat
```
Starts all 4 services in sequence.

### Stop All Services
```cmd
STOP_ALL_SERVICES.bat
```
Stops all 4 services in sequence.

### Individual Service Control

**Main Trading Engine**:
```cmd
START_MAIN.bat    # Start main auto trader
STOP_MAIN.bat     # Stop main auto trader
```

**Position Monitor**:
```cmd
START_MONITOR.bat    # Start position monitor
STOP_MONITOR.bat     # Stop position monitor
```

**EOD Cleanup**:
```cmd
START_EOD.bat    # Start EOD cleanup
STOP_EOD.bat     # Stop EOD cleanup
```

**Sell Order Manager**:
```cmd
START_SELL.bat    # Start sell order manager
STOP_SELL.bat     # Stop sell order manager
```

## Recommended Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Full Automation
Run all services continuously:
```cmd
# Start everything
START_ALL_SERVICES.bat

# Services run 24/7
# Main: Places orders when needed
# Monitor: Alerts you during market hours
# EOD: Runs cleanup at 6 PM daily
# Sell: Manages sell orders during market hours
```

### Pattern 2: Manual Control
Run only specific services as needed:
```cmd
# Morning: Place AMO orders
START_MAIN.bat
# ... waits for completion ...
STOP_MAIN.bat

# During market: Monitor positions
START_MONITOR.bat

# Evening: Daily cleanup
START_EOD.bat
```

### Pattern 3: Hybrid
Some services automated, some manual:
```cmd
# Automated: Monitor and sell management
START_MONITOR.bat
START_SELL.bat

# Manual: You control when to trade
# Run RUN_AGENT.bat when you want to place orders

# Automated: Daily cleanup
START_EOD.bat (scheduled at 6 PM)
```

## Service Configuration

### Startup Type
All services installed with: **Manual Start** (SERVICE_DEMAND_START)

To change to automatic startup:
```cmd
# Using NSSM
nssm set ModularTradeAgent_Main Start SERVICE_AUTO_START

# Or via Windows Services (services.msc)
# Right-click service → Properties → Startup type: Automatic
```

### Service Account
Default: **SYSTEM** account

To run as specific user:
```cmd
# Using NSSM
nssm set ModularTradeAgent_Main ObjectName DOMAIN\Username Password
```

## Windows Task Scheduler Alternative

If you prefer Task Scheduler over services:

### Main Trader (Daily 8 AM)
```
Trigger: Daily at 8:00 AM
Action: Run RUN_AGENT.bat
Conditions: Run only on weekdays
```

### Position Monitor (Market Hours)
```
Trigger: Daily at 9:15 AM
Action: Start service ModularTradeAgent_Monitor
Conditions: Stop at 3:30 PM
```

### EOD Cleanup (Daily 6 PM)
```
Trigger: Daily at 6:00 PM
Action: Start service ModularTradeAgent_EOD
Conditions: Run only on weekdays
```

## Monitoring Services

### Check Status
```cmd
# Using net command
net start | findstr ModularTradeAgent

# Using sc command
sc query ModularTradeAgent_Main
sc query ModularTradeAgent_Monitor
sc query ModularTradeAgent_EOD
sc query ModularTradeAgent_Sell
```

### View Logs
Logs are in: `C:\ProgramData\ModularTradeAgent\logs\`

```
ModularTradeAgent_Main.log         # Main trader output
ModularTradeAgent_Main_error.log   # Main trader errors
ModularTradeAgent_Monitor.log      # Monitor output
ModularTradeAgent_Monitor_error.log # Monitor errors
... (similar for EOD and Sell)
```

### Windows Event Viewer
Service start/stop events logged in:
- **Application and Services Logs** → **Windows Logs** → **System**
- Filter by source: "Service Control Manager"

## Service Dependencies

```
ModularTradeAgent_Main
  ├── No dependencies
  └── Core trading engine

ModularTradeAgent_Monitor
  ├── Reads from: trades_history.json
  └── Depends on: Main having created positions

ModularTradeAgent_EOD
  ├── Reads from: trades_history.json
  ├── Reads from: pending_orders.json
  └── Should run AFTER market hours

ModularTradeAgent_Sell
  ├── Reads from: trades_history.json
  └── Requires: Open positions to sell
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

**Error**: Service fails to start
- **Check**: Credentials in `kotak_neo.env` are correct
- **Check**: Python executable path is valid
- **Check**: Script exists at specified path
- **View**: Error log in `logs/` folder

### Service Crashes

**Error**: Service stops unexpectedly
- **Check**: Error logs in `logs/ModularTradeAgent_*.error.log`
- **Check**: Windows Event Viewer for crash details
- **Test**: Run script manually to see error:
  ```cmd
  cd C:\ProgramData\ModularTradeAgent\TradingAgent
  python modules\kotak_neo_auto_trader\run_auto_trade.py
  ```

### Multiple Services Conflict

**Issue**: Services interfere with each other
- **Solution**: Services are designed to work together
- **Check**: All use same `kotak_neo.env` file
- **Ensure**: Only one instance of each service runs

### High CPU/Memory Usage

**Issue**: Service consuming too many resources
- **Check**: Service running continuously when not needed
- **Solution**: Stop service when market is closed
- **Configure**: Reduce monitoring frequency in scripts

## Uninstalling Services

### Remove All Services
```cmd
# Using NSSM
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_Main confirm
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_Monitor confirm
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_EOD confirm
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_Sell confirm

# Or using sc
sc delete ModularTradeAgent_Main
sc delete ModularTradeAgent_Monitor
sc delete ModularTradeAgent_EOD
sc delete ModularTradeAgent_Sell
```

### Remove Installation
```cmd
# Stop all services first
STOP_ALL_SERVICES.bat

# Uninstall services
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_Main confirm
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_Monitor confirm
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_EOD confirm
nssm remove ModularTradeAgent_Sell confirm

# Delete installation directory
rmdir /s C:\ProgramData\ModularTradeAgent
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with One Service
- Begin with **ModularTradeAgent_Main** only
- Verify it works correctly
- Add other services gradually

### 2. Monitor Logs
- Check logs daily during initial setup
- Verify services are behaving as expected
- Set up log rotation for long-term usage

### 3. Test Before Production
- Run services manually first (RUN_AGENT.bat)
- Verify with small positions
- Monitor for several days before full automation

### 4. Backup Configuration
- Keep backup of `kotak_neo.env`
- Export service configurations (NSSM)
- Document any customizations

### 5. Resource Management
- Don't run unnecessary services
- Stop services when market is closed
- Monitor system resources
