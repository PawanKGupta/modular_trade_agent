# Phase 1 Implementation Progress

## Status: IN PROGRESS (Day 1)

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. Tracking Scope Module (`tracking_scope.py`)
**Purpose:** Manages which symbols are actively tracked by the system.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Add symbols to tracking when system places orders
- ✅ Check if symbol is actively tracked (`is_tracked()`)
- ✅ Get list of tracked symbols
- ✅ Update tracked quantity (for buys/sells)
- ✅ Auto-stop tracking when position fully closed (qty = 0)
- ✅ Track pre-existing quantity separately (not monitored)
- ✅ Maintain audit trail with tracking IDs

**SOLID Compliance:**
- Single Responsibility: Only manages tracking scope
- Open/Closed: Extensible for different tracking criteria
- Singleton pattern for easy access

**Storage:** `data/system_recommended_symbols.json`

**Example Usage:**
```python
from tracking_scope import add_tracked_symbol, is_tracked

# When order placed
tracking_id = add_tracked_symbol(
    symbol="RELIANCE",
    ticker="RELIANCE.NS",
    initial_order_id="ORDER-123",
    initial_qty=10,
    pre_existing_qty=50  # Already owned
)

# Check if tracked
if is_tracked("RELIANCE"):
    # Process this symbol
    pass
```

#### 2. Order Tracker Module (`order_tracker.py`)
**Purpose:** Tracks pending orders and their status lifecycle.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Extract order ID from broker response (handles multiple formats)
- ✅ Add orders to pending tracking
- ✅ Update order status (PENDING/EXECUTED/REJECTED/etc.)
- ✅ Search for orders in broker order book (60-sec fallback)
- ✅ Track partial fills with executed quantity
- ✅ Remove orders when execution completed

**SOLID Compliance:**
- Single Responsibility: Only manages order tracking
- Interface Segregation: Clean API for order operations
- Dependency Inversion: Abstract order status checking

**Storage:** `data/pending_orders.json`

**Example Usage:**
```python
from order_tracker import extract_order_id, add_pending_order

# Extract order ID from response
order_id = extract_order_id(broker_response)

if order_id:
    # Track this order
    add_pending_order(
        order_id=order_id,
        symbol="RELIANCE-EQ",
        ticker="RELIANCE.NS",
        qty=10,
        order_type="MARKET",
        variety="AMO"
    )
else:
    # Fallback: search order book after 60 seconds
    order_id = search_order_in_broker_orderbook(
        orders_api,
        symbol="RELIANCE-EQ",
        qty=10,
        after_timestamp=placement_time
    )
```

### 📋 Remaining Phase 1 Tasks

#### 3. Storage Helper Updates (Next)
- [ ] Add convenience functions to existing `storage.py`
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] No breaking changes

#### 4. Update `_attempt_place_order` (Critical)
- [ ] Change return type: `bool` → `Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]`
- [ ] Return order_id along with success status
- [ ] Implement 60-sec fallback if no order_id
- [ ] Update all callers (no breaking changes)

#### 5. Integration with Order Placement
- [ ] Register in tracking_scope when order placed
- [ ] Add to pending_orders for status monitoring
- [ ] Store recommendation metadata

#### 6. Scoped Reconciliation
- [ ] Modify `reconcile_holdings_to_history()`
- [ ] Only process tracked symbols
- [ ] Skip non-recommended holdings

#### 7. Logging Enhancement
- [ ] Log all tracking decisions
- [ ] Log order status changes
- [ ] Log scope boundaries
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 2 notifications

#### 8. Unit Tests
- [ ] Test tracking scope functions
- [ ] Test order ID extraction
- [ ] Test pending order management
- [ ] Test scoped reconciliation
- [ ] Place tests in `temp/` folder

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Separate Files for Separate Concerns
- `system_recommended_symbols.json` - Who to track
- `pending_orders.json` - Order status tracking
- `trades_history.json` - Executed trades (existing)
- `failed_orders.json` - Balance-failed orders (existing)

**Rationale:** Easier to maintain, faster reads, clear separation

### 2. Singleton Pattern
Both modules use singletons for easy access across codebase:
```python
# Instead of passing instances everywhere
from tracking_scope import is_tracked
from order_tracker import add_pending_order
```

### 3. No Breaking Changes
- All new code is additive
- Existing functionality untouched
- Integration happens in controlled steps

### 4. Logging Only (Phase 1)
- No notifications yet
- No automated actions
- Just log everything
- Verify correctness before Phase 2

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing (After Integration)
1. Place test AMO order (small qty, cheap stock)
2. Verify `system_recommended_symbols.json` created
3. Verify order appears in `pending_orders.json`
4. Check logs for tracking messages
5. Verify reconciliation only processes tracked symbol

### Unit Tests (To Create)
```python
# temp/test_tracking.py

def test_add_tracked_symbol():
    # Test adding symbol to tracking
    pass

def test_is_tracked():
    # Test tracking check
    pass

def test_extract_order_id():
    # Test order ID extraction from various formats
    pass

def test_pending_order_lifecycle():
    # Test adding, updating, removing orders
    pass
```

## Next Steps (Awaiting Approval)

**Ready to proceed with:**
1. Integration of tracking_scope into `_attempt_place_order()`
2. Update `auto_trade_engine.py` to use new modules
3. Modify reconciliation to respect tracking scope
4. Add comprehensive logging

**Questions:**
- Should I proceed with integration now?
- Any concerns with the current module design?
- Want to review code before proceeding?

## Timeline

**Day 1 (Today):**
- ✅ Tracking scope module
- ✅ Order tracker module
- 🔄 Integration (pending approval)

**Day 2:**
- [ ] Complete integration
- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Create unit tests
- [ ] Manual testing with dry-run

**Day 3:**
- [ ] Fix issues from testing
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Phase 1 completion review
- [ ] Prepare for Phase 2

## Risk Mitigation

### No Breaking Changes Guarantee
- All new code in separate files
- Existing code only extended, not modified
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Can be disabled by not using new functions

### Rollback Plan
If issues found:
1. New files can be deleted
2. Existing code unchanged
3. System works as before
4. No data loss

### Testing Before Production
- Dry-run mode first
- Small test orders
- Manual verification at each step
- User approval before Phase 2
