# Sell Engine Fixes - EMA9 & Tick Size

## Issues Found:

### 1. EMA9 Calculation Difference
**Problem:**
- TradingView shows: ₹170.10 (at LTP ₹163.15)
- Our system calculated: ₹170.17
- Difference: ₹0.07 (0.04%)

**Root Cause:**
- Using yfinance data which may have slight delays or use different historical candles
- TradingView uses real-time broker data, we use yfinance as fallback

**Impact:**
- Minor difference (₹0.07) is acceptable for automated trading
- Both systems use same EMA formula: `EMA_today = (LTP × 0.2) + (EMA_yesterday × 0.8)`
- Difference likely due to data source timing/resolution

**Status:** ✅ Working as designed (data source difference is expected)

### 2. Order Rejected - Tick Size Error
**Problem:**
- Order price: ₹170.17450305745825 (too many decimals)
- NSE requires prices in multiples of tick size (₹0.05)
- Order was rejected by exchange

**Root Cause:**
- System was passing raw floating-point calculation to order API
- Did not round to valid tick size before placing order

**Fix Applied:**
✅ Added `round_to_tick_size()` function to sell_engine.py
- Rounds all prices to NSE tick size (₹0.05)
- Applied to both initial orders and order updates
- ₹170.17450... → ₹170.15 (nearest ₹0.05 multiple)

**NSE Tick Size Rules:**
- Most stocks: ₹0.05 tick size
- Formula: `round(price / 0.05) * 0.05`
- Always 2 decimal places

## Changes Made:

### File: `sell_engine.py`

1. **Added tick size rounding function:**
```python
@staticmethod
def round_to_tick_size(price: float) -> float:
    """Round price to NSE tick size (₹0.05)"""
    if price <= 0:
        return price
    tick_size = 0.05
    rounded = round(price / tick_size) * tick_size
    return round(rounded, 2)
```

2. **Applied rounding in `place_sell_order()`:**
- Rounds `target_price` before placing order
- Logs the rounding for transparency

3. **Applied rounding in `update_sell_order()`:**
- Rounds `new_price` before updating order
- Updates tracking with rounded price

## Test Example:

### Before Fix:
```
Price: ₹170.17450305745825 ❌ Rejected
```

### After Fix:
```
Price: ₹170.17450... → ₹170.15 ✅ Accepted
(Rounded to nearest ₹0.05 tick)
```

## Impact on Trading:

### Price Rounding Examples:
- ₹170.17 → ₹170.15 (down ₹0.02)
- ₹170.18 → ₹170.20 (up ₹0.02)
- ₹170.12 → ₹170.10 (down ₹0.02)
- ₹170.13 → ₹170.15 (up ₹0.02)

**Maximum rounding impact:** ±₹0.025 per share (±0.015%)

### For GOKULAGRO (4 shares):
- Original EMA9: ₹170.17
- Rounded: ₹170.15
- Difference per share: ₹0.02
- Total impact: ₹0.08 (4 shares × ₹0.02)
- Impact %: 0.01% of total value

**Conclusion:** Tick size rounding has negligible impact on profitability.

## Next Test:

With these fixes, the sell order should now:
1. ✅ Calculate EMA9 correctly (within data source variance)
2. ✅ Round price to valid tick size (₹0.05)
3. ✅ Place order successfully without rejection
4. ✅ Track lowest EMA9 and update orders accordingly

## Ready to Retest:

**Test Plan:**
1. Clear session cache
2. Run sell engine again with GOKULAGRO position
3. Verify:
   - Price rounded to ₹170.15 or ₹170.20 (nearest ₹0.05)
   - Order accepted by exchange
   - Order visible in Kotak Neo app

**Command:**
```bash
python -m modules.kotak_neo_auto_trader.run_sell_orders --env modules\kotak_neo_auto_trader\kotak_neo.env
```
