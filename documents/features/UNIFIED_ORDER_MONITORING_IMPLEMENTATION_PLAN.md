## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for extending the existing sell order monitoring system to include AMO buy order tracking, reconciliation, and state management. The goal is to create a unified order monitoring system that handles both buy and sell orders during market hours with proper status tracking, failure handling, and user visibility.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Sell Order Monitoring**: `SellOrderManager.monitor_and_update()` runs every minute during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM)
- **Order State Manager**: `OrderStateManager.sync_with_broker()` syncs sell orders with broker status
- **Trading Service**: `TradingService.run_sell_monitor()` orchestrates continuous monitoring
- **Broker API**: `orders.get_orders()` and `orders.get_executed_orders()` already fetch all orders

### Current Gaps
1. AMO buy orders never verified after placement (rejection tracking gap)
2. Failed orders hidden in metadata/JSON, not exposed via API
3. Manual cancellations/modifications not detected for buy orders
4. Retry queue not visible or controllable via UI
5. `pending_orders.json` grows indefinitely without cleanup
6. No notifications for buy order state changes

## Implementation Goals

1. **Unified Monitoring**: Single system monitors both buy and sell orders during market hours
2. **Status Reconciliation**: Poll broker to verify order status (immediate + market hours)
3. **First-Class Statuses**: Explicit order statuses (failed, retry_pending, rejected, cancelled)
4. **Manual Activity Detection**: Track manual cancellations/modifications for buy orders
5. **Retry Queue Visibility**: API/UI to view and manage failed orders
6. **Database Migration**: Move pending orders from JSON to DB with dual-write transition
7. **Comprehensive Notifications**: Alert users on all order state changes

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Orders Table Enhancements
```sql
-- Add new status values
ALTER TYPE orderstatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'failed';
ALTER TYPE orderstatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'retry_pending';
ALTER TYPE orderstatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'rejected';
ALTER TYPE orderstatus ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'pending_execution';

-- Add new columns
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS failure_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_failed_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_retry_attempt TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS retry_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS rejection_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cancelled_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_status_check TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS execution_price NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS execution_qty NUMERIC;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS execution_time TIMESTAMP;
```

### 2. Unified Order Monitor

**New Component**: `OrderMonitor` (extends/refactors `SellOrderManager`)
- Monitors both buy and sell orders in single loop
- Queries broker once per cycle for all orders
- Updates status for both order types
- Handles execution, rejection, cancellation for both

**Key Methods**:
- `monitor_all_orders()` - Main monitoring loop (replaces `monitor_and_update()`)
- `check_buy_order_status()` - Check AMO buy order status
- `check_sell_order_status()` - Check sell order status (existing)
- `update_order_status_in_db()` - Update order status in database
- `handle_order_execution()` - Process executed orders (buy and sell)
- `handle_order_rejection()` - Process rejected orders
- `handle_order_cancellation()` - Process cancelled orders

### 3. Order State Manager Extensions

**Extend `OrderStateManager`**:
- Add `active_buy_orders` tracking (similar to `active_sell_orders`)
- Extend `sync_with_broker()` to handle buy orders
- Add buy order status update methods
- Track buy order execution and update trade history

### 4. Trading Service Integration

**Modify `TradingService.run_sell_monitor()`**:
- Rename to `run_order_monitor()` (or keep name, extend functionality)
- Load pending AMO buy orders from DB at start
- Add buy orders to monitoring alongside sell orders
- Use same polling interval (every minute during market hours)

      - `REJECTED` → `REJECTED` (order rejected by broker)
      - `CANCELLED` → `CLOSED` (order cancelled)
      - `PENDING` (broker processing: "trigger pending", "AMO req received") → `PENDING_EXECUTION`
      - `OPEN` (broker accepted, waiting execution) → `PENDING_EXECUTION`
    - **Internal statuses** (our system):
      - `PENDING` (recommended but not placed, retry pending, manual fill, portfolio full) → `AMO` or `RETRY_PENDING`

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Dual-write implementation (all methods write to both DB and JSON)
- ✅ Dual-read implementation (all methods read from DB first, JSON fallback)
- ✅ Feature flag support (use_db parameter)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Order status transitions
- Broker API mocking
- State manager operations
- Notification triggers

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end order placement → monitoring → execution
- Dual-write/read operations
- Migration scripts
- API endpoints

### E2E Tests
- Full order lifecycle (place → monitor → execute/reject)
- Manual cancellation detection
- Retry queue operations
- UI interactions

### Performance Tests
- Database query performance
- Broker API rate limiting
- Concurrent order monitoring
- Large order volume handling

## Migration Plan

### Data Migration
1. **Existing Failed Orders**: Migrate from `order_metadata["failed_order"]` to explicit status
2. **Pending Orders JSON**: Migrate `pending_orders.json` entries to DB
3. **Status Updates**: Update existing AMO orders with new status values

### Code Migration
1. **Dual-Write Period**: 2 weeks (write to both JSON and DB)
2. **Dual-Read Period**: 1 week (read from DB, fallback to JSON)
3. **DB-Only Period**: Remove JSON dependency

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flags for each phase
- Database migration rollback scripts
- JSON backup before migration

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All AMO buy orders verified after placement (immediate + market hours)
2. ✅ Failed orders visible in UI with clear status and reason
3. ✅ Manual cancellations/modifications detected and updated
4. ✅ Retry queue accessible via API/UI with manual controls
5. ✅ Pending orders stored in DB (no JSON dependency)
6. ✅ Notifications sent for all order state changes
7. ✅ Unified monitoring system handles both buy and sell orders
8. ✅ Zero data loss during migration
9. ✅ Performance acceptable (< 1 second per monitoring cycle)
10. ✅ All tests passing

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Database schema & models
- **Week 2**: Unified order monitor core
- **Week 3**: State manager extensions & trading service integration
- **Week 4**: Immediate polling & failure status promotion
- **Week 5**: Pending orders migration & retry queue API/UI
- **Week 6**: Notifications & manual activity detection
- **Week 7**: Cleanup, optimization, documentation

**Total Duration**: 7 weeks

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Broker API Rate Limits**: Batch queries, add delays, cache responses
2. **Data Loss During Migration**: Backup JSON, dual-write period, rollback scripts
3. **Performance Degradation**: Database indexes, query optimization, monitoring
4. **Breaking Changes**: Feature flags, gradual rollout, backward compatibility
5. **Notification Spam**: Rate limiting, user preferences, batching

## Dependencies

- Database migration tools (Alembic)
- Broker API access (Kotak Neo)
- Notification services (Telegram)
- UI framework (React)
- Testing framework (pytest)

## Open Questions

1. Should we create separate `pending_orders` table or use `orders` table with status?
2. What notification channels besides Telegram? (Email, SMS, Push)
3. How long to keep historical order data? (Retention policy)
4. Should manual retry respect portfolio limits?
5. What's the acceptable polling interval? (Currently 1 minute)

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create detailed technical specifications for each phase
3. Set up development environment and branch strategy
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Schedule weekly progress reviews
