## What is This?

The **Modular Trade Agent** is an automated trading analysis system that:

- ‚úÖ **Analyzes** Indian stock markets (NSE) for trading opportunities
- ‚úÖ **Identifies** oversold stocks in strong uptrends (reversal strategy)
- ‚úÖ **Validates** signals using 2-year historical backtesting
- ‚úÖ **Sends** trade alerts via Telegram with buy/sell recommendations
- ‚úÖ **Runs** automatically in the cloud (GitHub Actions) or on your computer

**Think of it as:** Your personal trading research assistant that analyzes stocks and sends you trade recommendations!

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### For Windows Users (Easiest Method)

**Option 1: Use the Pre-Built Executable (No Python Required!)**

1. Download `ModularTradeAgent.exe` 
2. Double-click to run
3. Follow the on-screen prompts
4. Done! ‚úÖ

üëâ **See:** [EXECUTABLE_README.md](../../EXECUTABLE_README.md) for details

**Option 2: Use the All-in-One Installer**

1. Download `ModularTradeAgent_Setup.exe`
2. Run as Administrator
3. Enter your Telegram credentials in the GUI
4. The installer handles everything automatically!

üëâ **See:** [ALL_IN_ONE_INSTALLER_GUIDE.md](../ALL_IN_ONE_INSTALLER_GUIDE.md) for details

---

### For Developers (Full Setup)

Continue reading below for the complete Python setup.

---

## Detailed Setup

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

You'll need:

- **Python 3.8+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - During install, check "Add Python to PATH"
- **Internet connection** - For downloading stock data
- **Telegram account** (optional) - For receiving trade alerts

**Check if Python is installed:**
```powershell
python --version
```
You should see: `Python 3.8.0` or higher

---

### Step 2: Download the Project

**Option A: Using Git (Recommended)**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/modular_trade_agent.git
cd modular_trade_agent
```

**Option B: Download ZIP**
1. Download the ZIP file from GitHub
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\TradingAgent`)
3. Open PowerShell in that folder

---

### Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps this project's dependencies separate from other Python projects.

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Windows PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# You should see (.venv) in your prompt now
```

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will take 2-5 minutes. You'll see packages being downloaded and installed.

---

### Step 5: Configure Telegram (Optional but Recommended)

To receive trade alerts on your phone:

**5.1: Create a Telegram Bot**
1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send: `/newbot`
3. Follow prompts to name your bot
4. **Copy the bot token** (looks like: `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

**5.2: Get Your Chat ID**
1. Search for `@userinfobot` on Telegram
2. Send: `/start`
3. **Copy your chat ID** (looks like: `987654321`)

**5.3: Create Configuration File**

Create a file named `cred.env` in the project root:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=987654321
```

Replace with your actual token and chat ID!

---

### Step 6: Test Telegram Connection (Optional)

```powershell
python test_telegram.py
```

You should receive a test message on Telegram! üéâ

---

## First Run

### Basic Analysis (Without Backtesting)

```powershell
python trade_agent.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch the latest stock list (takes ~30 seconds)
2. Analyze each stock (1-2 minutes for 10-20 stocks)
3. Generate buy/sell recommendations
4. Send Telegram alerts (if configured)
5. Save results to CSV files

**You'll see output like:**
```
2025-10-29 16:50:30 ‚Äî INFO ‚Äî Starting trade agent analysis...
2025-10-29 16:50:45 ‚Äî SUCCESS ‚Äî RELIANCE.NS: buy
2025-10-29 16:50:50 ‚Äî SUCCESS ‚Äî TCS.NS: strong_buy
2025-10-29 16:51:00 ‚Äî INFO ‚Äî Analysis complete! 2 BUY signals found.
```

---

### Advanced Analysis (With Backtesting)

For higher-quality signals validated against 2 years of history:

```powershell
python trade_agent.py --backtest
```

**This takes longer** (5-10 minutes) but provides much better signals with historical validation!

---

## Understanding the Output

### Console Output

```
2025-10-29 16:50:50 ‚Äî SUCCESS ‚Äî RELIANCE.NS: strong_buy
```

- **SUCCESS** = Signal generated
- **RELIANCE.NS** = Stock symbol (NSE)
- **strong_buy** = Signal strength (strong_buy > buy > watch > avoid)

---

### Telegram Alert Example

```
üìà BUY candidates (sorted by priority):

1. RELIANCE.NS:
   Buy (2850-2867)
   Target 3100 (+8.6%)
   Stop 2695 (-5.5%)
   RSI:23.18
   MTF:9/10
   RR:1.6x
   StrongSupp:0.3%
   PE:22.5
   Vol:1.2x
   News:Neu +0.00 (1)
   Backtest: 43/100 (+6.7% return, 100% win, 2 trades)
   Combined Score: 38.5/100
   Priority Score: 85 ‚úÖ HIGH PRIORITY
```

**What does this mean?**

- **Buy (2850-2867)** = Buy between ‚Çπ2850-‚Çπ2867
- **Target 3100** = Sell target at ‚Çπ3100 (+8.6% profit)
- **Stop 2695** = Stop-loss at ‚Çπ2695 (-5.5% risk)
- **RSI:23.18** = Oversold level (good for reversal)
- **MTF:9/10** = Multi-timeframe alignment score (9/10 is excellent!)
- **RR:1.6x** = Risk-reward ratio (1.6:1)
- **PE:22.5** = Price-to-earnings ratio
- **Backtest:43/100** = Historical performance score
- **Priority Score:85** = Overall priority ranking

### 4. Customize Your Strategy

Want to adjust trading parameters?

Edit `config/settings.py`:
```python
RSI_OVERSOLD = 30              # Change oversold threshold
MIN_VOLUME_MULTIPLIER = 1.0    # Adjust volume filter
LOOKBACK_DAYS = 90             # Change historical period
```

üëâ **See:** [ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md](../ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md) for advanced customization

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Python not found"

**Solution:**
- Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- Or use full path: `C:\Python39\python.exe trade_agent.py`

---

### Issue 2: "Module not found" errors

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Issue 3: "No stocks found"

**Possible causes:**
- Internet connection issue
- ChartInk screener temporarily unavailable
- Weekend/holiday (markets closed)

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Run on a weekday during market hours

---

### Issue 4: "Telegram not working"

**Solution:**
- Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `cred.env`
- Test with: `python test_telegram.py`
- Make sure you've started a chat with your bot first

---

### Issue 5: Antivirus blocking executable

**Solution:**
- Add executable to antivirus exclusions
- This is a false positive (common with PyInstaller)
- Or use Python source code instead of executable
