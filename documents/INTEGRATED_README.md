# Integrated Backtest-Trade Agent Workflow

## Overview

The Integrated Backtest-Trade Agent Workflow combines the power of historical backtesting with live trade agent analysis to create a comprehensive testing and analysis framework. This system coordinates two main modules:

1. **Backtesting Module** (`run_backtest`) - Identifies potential entry/re-entry dates based on EMA200 + RSI10 strategy
2. **Trade Agent Module** (`trade_agent`) - Validates signals using advanced multi-timeframe analysis

## Key Features

- 🔍 **Signal Identification**: Uses backtesting logic to find potential buy/re-entry opportunities
- 🤖 **Trade Agent Validation (historical-as-of)**: Each signal is validated strictly as-of the buy_date (no future data leakage)
- ✅ **Selective Execution**: Only trades with "BUY" confirmation are executed
- 🎯 **Targets = EMA9 at execution**: Target is set to EMA9 on the execution day (next trading day open)
- 🛑 **No Stop-Loss (by design)**: Exits occur on target hit or at backtest period end; risk is handled via re-entries/averaging
- ➕ **Re-entry Aggregation**: Subsequent BUYs while a position is open are averaged into the same position (single trade), target updated
- 🧭 **Pyramiding Handling**:
  - With no open position: treat pyramiding signals as initial entries only if Close > EMA200; otherwise silently skip
  - With open position: treat as re-entries (averaging)
- 🧹 **Clean Logging**: Skipped pyramiding signals (no position) are not printed; derived initial prints as "Initial entry"
- 📊 **Complete Separation**: Maintains independence from main project logic

## Execution Rules (current)

1. Backtest engine emits potential signals (initial and pyramiding) with Close/EMA200/RSI context.
2. If no position is open:
   - Accept initial-entry signals
   - Accept pyramiding-labelled signals only if Close > EMA200 (treated as initial entry)
   - Otherwise silently skip
3. If a position is open:
   - Accept BUY signals as re-entries; add capital/quantity, recompute average entry; update target to EMA9 at re-entry date
4. Trade Agent verdicts are computed strictly as-of the signal date
5. Tracking is incremental between signals; final pass closes any remaining open position at period end if target not reached

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. `run_backtest(stock_name, date_range)`
- **Input**: Stock symbol and date range
- **Process**: Runs EMA200 + RSI10 strategy logic
- **Output**: List of potential buy/re-entry dates with execution details

#### 2. `trade_agent(stock_name, buy_date)`
- **Input**: Stock symbol and specific analysis date
- **Process**: Advanced multi-timeframe analysis using existing core modules
- **Output**: SignalResult object with signal type ("BUY" or "WATCH"), prices, and confidence

#### 3. `run_integrated_backtest(stock_name, date_range)`
- **Coordination**: Main integration method that orchestrates the workflow
- **Logic**: 
  1. Get potential signals from backtest
  2. Validate each signal through trade agent
  3. Execute trades only on "BUY" signals
  4. Track positions until exit conditions
  5. Reset indicators after successful target achievement

## Signal Flow

```
Backtest Engine → Potential Signals → Trade Agent Validation → Execution Decision
        ↓                ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   EMA200+RSI10     Entry Dates        BUY/WATCH Signal    Execute/Skip Trade
                                           ↓
                                   Position Tracking
                                           ↓
                              Target Hit → Reset Indicators
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from integrated_backtest import run_integrated_backtest, print_integrated_results

# Run integrated backtest
stock = "RELIANCE.NS"
date_range = ("2022-01-01", "2023-12-31")

results = run_integrated_backtest(stock, date_range)
print_integrated_results(results)
```

### CLI Quick Test

Use the generic tester to run any stock/period without writing scripts:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_integrated.py RELIANCE.NS 2024-01-01 2025-10-18
# Quiet mode
.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_integrated.py RELIANCE.NS 2024-01-01 2025-10-18 --quiet
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Custom capital allocation
results = run_integrated_backtest(
    stock_name="AAPL",
    date_range=("2023-01-01", "2023-12-31"),
    capital_per_position=50000  # $50K per position
)
```

## Example Scripts

### 1. `integrated_example.py`
Comprehensive demonstration script with multiple examples:
- Single stock analysis
- Multiple stock comparison
- Different time period analysis
- Strategy validation metrics

### 2. Running Examples
```bash
# Run the comprehensive example suite
python integrated_example.py

# Run basic integrated backtest
python integrated_backtest.py
```

## Results Structure

Notes:
- Positions may include multiple fills (re-entries) aggregated under a single trade; `entry_price` is the average entry.
- Targets are EMA9 at the (initial/re-entry) execution dates.
- No stop-loss; positions close on target hit or at period end.

The integrated backtest returns comprehensive results:

```python
{
    'stock_name': 'RELIANCE.NS',
    'period': '2022-01-01 to 2023-12-31',
    'total_signals': 15,          # Total backtest signals found
    'executed_trades': 8,         # Trade agent approved signals
    'skipped_signals': 7,         # Trade agent rejected signals
    'trade_agent_accuracy': 53.3, # Approval rate percentage
    'total_return_pct': 12.5,     # Strategy return
    'win_rate': 62.5,             # Percentage of winning trades
    'strategy_vs_buy_hold': 3.2,  # Outperformance vs buy & hold
    'positions': [...],           # Detailed position data
}
```

## Key Advantages
